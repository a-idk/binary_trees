# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

Definition:
	- A tree-like data structure where each node has at most two child nodes, called the "left child" and "right child."
	- The first node, called the "root," has no parent.
	- Each node can store data and links to its children.

Project Definition:
To achieve this, the following concepts were understood and implemented.
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
